# Thesis team at the University of Edinburgh
This repository contains a copy PyPSA-Eur. All new storage technologies will be implemented and tested here. This allows real life experience in software collaboration - an extreme useful skill!

## TEAM AND TOPICS: 
- Sahil Jotwani (SES) "Applied review: Modelling and analysing conventional and novel long-term energy storage in a multi-year UK mini-example with PyPSA-Eur-Sec ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§"
- Jason Poon (EPE) "Applied review: Modelling and analysing short and long-term storage by resampled timeseries in UK mini-example with PyPSA-Eur ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§"
- Yizhuo Ying (SES) "Considering flexibility of energy storage by including unit-commitment constraints in PyPSA"
- Anas Algarai (SES), "Planning Saudi Arabiaâ€™s energy transition for 2030 with PyPSA-Earth", co-supervised by colleagues from leading Turkish universities.


## NEXT STEPS:
- watch the PyPSA-Eur tutorial on Youtube [Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ty47YU1_eeQ) and get active with [Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAwhQnNRIvs)
- follow the 1 day [hackathon](https://github.com/pypsa-meets-africa/pypsa-africa-hackathon) to understand how to use PyPSA-Africa in mpre detail (similar to PyPSA-Eur). Please all of you install [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview).
- Storage Team:
  - make yourself familiar what data is required for energy storage (read the below listed "energy storage data base" and the above under useful links listed "Porters storage integration" which points you directly to the relevant scripts that require changes)
  - read about energy storage. Add articles that contain relevant data [here](https://github.com/pz-max/storage-team/blob/main/energy-storage-literature.csv).
  - while reading add data into our ["energy storage database"](https://github.com/pz-max/storage-team/blob/main/energy-storage-database.csv) (by commits into GitHub)
- Team Saudi-Arabia:
  - For you the PyPSA-Africa hackathon and the PyPSA-Africa GitHub repository are key for you.
  - Read also about mulitple national plans of your country and collect all the assumptions. How are these are also modelled? Open source?
- **milestone: write the mission statement until 01.04.22**
